# The only accessibility statement you need
- ⚠️ Always use HTML when possible.
- 💡 There is an in-depth article [The accessibility statement at Axess Lab](http://axesslab.com).

## About the template
This accessibility statement template is based on the demands from the EU-directive for the public sector [LINK].
The focus is on assisting the user rather than merely outlining legal requirements and shortcomings/failures. 

### What does the law say?
Well, it is not (as of writing this template) very clear how to do it and the law does not specify an accessibility statement. What is clear is that you need to document and save the documentation. 
You also need to report issues to the government agency in each country you are active in.

#### Documentation required
> [CHAPTER IV  Obligations of service providers  Article 13  Obligations of service providers](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019L0882#cpt_IV)
> 
> 2.   Service providers shall prepare the necessary information in accordance with Annex V and shall explain how the services meet the applicable accessibility requirements. **The information shall be made available to the public in written and oral format, including in a manner which is accessible to persons with disabilities.** Service providers shall keep that information for as long as the service is in operation.
> 
> 4.   In the case of non-conformity, service providers shall take the corrective measures necessary to bring the service into conformity with the applicable accessibility requirements. Furthermore, where the service is not compliant with applicable accessibility requirements, service providers **shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which the service is provided**, to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken.

[Annex V-  Information on services meeting accessibility requirements](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019L0882#anx_V)
> 1. The service provider shall include the information assessing how the service meets the accessibility requirements referred to in Article 4 in the general terms and conditions, or equivalent document. The information shall describe the applicable requirements and cover, as far as relevant for the assessment the design and the operation of the service. In addition to the consumer information requirements of Directive 2011/83/EU, the information shall, where applicable, contain the following elements:
> 
> > a. a general description of the service in accessible formats;
> 
> > b. descriptions and explanations necessary for the understanding of the operation of the service;
> 
> > c. a description of how the relevant accessibility requirements set out in Annex I are met by the service.
> 
> 2. To comply with point 1 of this Annex the service provider may apply in full or in part the harmonised standards and technical specifications, for which references have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
> 
> 3. The service provider shall provide information demonstrating that the service delivery process and its monitoring ensure compliance of the service with point 1 of this Annex and with the applicable requirements of this Directive.

#### Disproportionate burden
For the public sector the government agencies have been very strict in what they accept as disproportionate burden. In Sweden, Digg has stated that if a company risks bankruptcy by implementing accessibility fixes immediately, it is still required to make the fixes but may plan to do so over a longer period.
[Criteria for assessment of disproportionate burden](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019L0882#anx_VI)
The directive says that an assessment needs to be made and documented to be able to claim disproportionate burden.
